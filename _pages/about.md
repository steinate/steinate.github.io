I am a second-year Ph.D. student in Department of Electronic Engineering, Tsinghua University, supervised by [Yuan Shen](https://oa.ee.tsinghua.edu.cn/~shenyuan/), jointly trained with Shanghai AI laboratory, supervised by [Jiangmiao Pang](https://oceanpang.github.io/). 

Before that, I received my B.S. degree in Electronic Engineering from Shanghai Jiao Tong University in 2023, supervised by [Weiyao Lin](https://weiyaolin.github.io/). I also spend a wonderful time in OpenGVLab in 2023, supervised by [Jifeng Dai](https://jifengdai.org/) and [Wenhai Wang](https://whai362.github.io/).

My research interests center on 3D computer vision and its applications in autonomous robotic systems. Building upon this foundation, my doctoral work aims to advance embodied artificial intelligence systems through the seamless integration of perception, planning, and control. 

This technical pursuit aligns with my ultimate aspiration to pioneer the realization of [Artificial Fluctlight](https://swordartonline.fandom.com/wiki/Project_Alicization) - a theoretical framework for human-like conscious embodiment in synthetic environments.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](https://fontawesome.com/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them. -->
